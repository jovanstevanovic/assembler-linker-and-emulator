# Assembler, Linker, and Emulator

Assembler & Linker:
I designed a two-pass assembler and linker to convert assembly code into executable machine code seamlessly. This
involved parsing, symbol resolution, and code generation.

Emulator:
In addition, I developed an emulator that replicated the behavior of the fictional architecture. This allowed for
program testing and execution within a simulated environment.
